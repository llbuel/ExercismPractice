# Secret Handshake

You and your fellow cohort of those in the "know" when it comes to binary decide to come up with a secret "handshake".

```bash
1 = wink
10 = double blink
100 = close your eyes
1000 = jump
```

10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake.
Given a decimal number, convert it to the appropriate sequence of events for a secret handshake.

## Example

```cpp
commands(3) == {"wink", "double blink"}
commands(19) == {"double blink", "wink"}
```
