# Pascal's Triangle

Compute Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.

In Pascal's Triangle each number is computed by adding the numbers to the right and left of the current position in the previous row.

        1
       1 1
      1 2 1
     1 3 3 1
    1 4 6 4 1
    # ... etc

## Example

```cpp
generate_rows(5) == {{1},
                     {1,1},
                     {1,2,1},
                     {1,3,3,1},
                     {1,4,6,4,1}};
```
