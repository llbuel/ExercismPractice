# Gigasecond

**Note:** The tests on this program use the Boost date-time library.

Given a moment, determine the moment that would be after a gigasecond has passed.

A gigasecond is 10^(9) (1,000,000,000) seconds.

## Example

```cpp
advance(time_from_string("2011-04-25 00:00:00")) == time_from_string("2043-01-01 01:46:40")
```
