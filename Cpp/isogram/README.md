# Isogram

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

* lumberjacks
* background
* downstream
* six-year-old

The word "isograms", however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.

## Example

```cpp
is_isogram("downstream") == true;
is_isogram("book") == false;
```
